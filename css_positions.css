/* CSS Positions */

/* static - is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page */

/* relative - is positioned relative to its normal position - Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties */

/* fixed - is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. 
The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element. */

/* absolute - is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). */

/* sticky - A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. */


/* CSS - Float property */

/* property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container. */

/* left - The element floats to the left of its container */
/* right - The element floats to the right of its container */
/* none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default */
/* inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent */


/* CSS - Display property */

/* Display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout */
/* inline, none, block (start on a new line)  */
